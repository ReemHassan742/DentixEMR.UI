# DentixEMR.UI
DentixEMR UI is the frontend layer of DentixEMR – A Smart Dental Electronic Medical Record System. It is a desktop application built with Avalonia UI following the MVVM architecture pattern.

The UI is designed with a role-based structure, providing separate interfaces for Doctor, Assistant (Receptionist), and Admin, ensuring clear workflows and better usability. Each role has dedicated screens for managing patients, appointments, medical records, alerts, and system administration.

The project focuses on:

Clean MVVM separation (Views & ViewModels)

Scalable and maintainable UI architecture

Desktop-first experience

Integration-ready design for .NET backend services and EF Core
